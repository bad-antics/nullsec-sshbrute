# SSH Brute Force Methods Guide

## Overview
SSH authentication testing and brute force techniques.

## Attack Methods

### Password Attacks
- Dictionary attacks
- Credential stuffing
- Common password lists
- Keyboard patterns

### Key-Based Attacks
- Default key testing
- Weak key detection
- Key file discovery
- Known key databases

### Username Enumeration
- Timing analysis
- Response differences
- Common usernames
- LDAP integration

## Optimization

### Performance
- Connection pooling
- Parallel threads
- Rate limiting awareness
- Timeout tuning

### Evasion
- IP rotation
- Timing jitter
- Fail2ban awareness
- Log minimization

## Wordlists

### Username Lists
- root, admin, user
- Service accounts
- Common patterns
- Enumerated users

### Password Lists
- Top 1000 passwords
- Keyboard walks
- Leet speak variants
- Year/season combos

## Detection Awareness
- Account lockout thresholds
- Connection limits
- SIEM alerts
- Rate limiting

## Success Indicators
- Shell access
- Key acceptance
- Banner differences
